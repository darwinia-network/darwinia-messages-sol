/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

// # BSC(Binance Smart Chain) parlia light client
//
// The bsc parlia light client provides functionality for import finalized headers which submitted by
// relayer and import finalized authority set
//
// ## Overview
//
// The bsc-light-client provides functions for:
//
// - Import finalized bsc block header
// - Verify message storage proof from latest finalized block header
//
// ### Terminology
//
// - [`BSCHeader`]: The header structure of Binance Smart Chain.
//
// - `genesis_header` The initial header which set to this contract before it accepts the headers
//   submitted by relayers. We extract the initial authority set from this header and verify the
//   headers submitted later with the extracted initial authority set. So the genesis_header must
//   be verified manually.
//
// - `checkpoint` checkpoint is the block that fulfill block number % epoch_length == 0. This
//   concept comes from the implementation of Proof of Authority consensus algorithm
//
// ### Implementations
// If you want to review the code, you may need to read about Authority Round and Proof of
// Authority consensus algorithms first. Then you may look into the go implementation of bsc source
// code and probably focus on the consensus algorithm that bsc is using. Read the bsc official docs
// if you need them. For this pallet:
// The first thing you should care about is the configuration parameters of this pallet. Check the
// bsc official docs even the go source code to make sure you set them correctly
// In bsc explorer, choose a checkpoint block's header to set as the genesis header of this pallet.
// It's not important which block you take, but it's important that the relayers should submit
// headers from `genesis_header.number + epoch_length` Probably you need a tool to finish this,
// like POSTMAN For bsc testnet, you can access API https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545 with
// following body input to get the header content.
// ```json
// {
//    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
//    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
//    "params": [
//        "0x913640",
//        false
//    ],
//    "id": 83
// }
// ```
// According to the official doc of Binance Smart Chain, when the authority set changed at
// checkpoint header, the new authority set is not taken as finalized immediately.
// We will wait(accept and verify) N / 2 blocks(only headers) to make sure it's safe to finalize
// the new authority set. N is the authority set size.
//
// ```
//                       Finalized               Block
//                       Checkpoint              Header
// ----------------------|-----------------------|---------> time
//                       |-------- N/2 ----------|
//                                Authority set
